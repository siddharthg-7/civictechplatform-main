**Civic Platform** is a modern, real-time citizen engagement application designed to bridge the gap between residents and their local municipalities. It empowers citizens to report local issues, propose community-driven projects, and participate in decision-making through a transparent voting system.

##  Key Features

###  Citizen Portal
- **Real-time Complaint Tracking**: Raise complaints (Roads, Water, Garbage, etc.) and monitor their status from "Pending" to "Resolved" with live updates.
- **Project Proposals**: Propose new local development ideas (zebra crossings, parks, street lights) to your community.
- **Community Polls**: Cast your vote on proposed projects in your neighborhood.
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Track your civic activities, statistics, and municipality announcements.

###  Admin Dashboard (Municipality View)
- **Centralized Complaint Management**: View all platform-wide complaints, filter by location or type, and update statuses in real-time.
- **User Insights**: Monitor active user registration and platform growth.
- **Transparent Decisions**: Log official actions based on community voting results.

##  Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, Vanilla CSS (Premium Custom Design).
- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database).
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect) with real-time Firebase Snapshots.
- **Real-time**: Firestore `onSnapshot` for live interactivity without page reloads.
